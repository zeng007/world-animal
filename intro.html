          <h2>The Legendary, Extinct and Imaginary</h2>

        <p class="grey left">  There are many ways countries try to show that they are superior to others. A common method is to use feared symbols on their country’s flag, Coat of Arms or other important places. The symbol usually chosen is an animal, often regarded as the national animal of that country. These animals symbolize a characteristic that the country believes itself to possess.</p>

        <h2>Lion</h2>

      <p class="grey left">  Lion is used to symbolize bravery, strength, courage and power. The Barbary lion is a national animal of England. In the Middle Ages, the lions kept in the menagerie at the Tower of London were Barbary lions. English medieval warrior rulers with a reputation for bravery attracted the nickname "the Lion": the most famous example is Richard I of England, known as Richard the Lionheart. Lions are frequently depicted in English heraldry, either as a device on shields themselves, or as supporters. They also appear in sculpture, and sites of national importance. The lion is used as a symbol of English sporting teams, such as the England national cricket team..</p>

        <h2>Rooster</h2>

      <p class="grey left"> In ancient time, French kings adopted the rooster as a symbol of courage and bravery. During the Revolution, the rooster became the symbol of people and of the State. The origin of this emblem dates back to Ancient history. At that time, Romans were laughing at Gauls because of a linguistic coincidence – in Latin, the word gallus means Gaul… but also rooster! With time, the French kings adopted the rooster as a symbol of courage and bravery. During the Revolution, the rooster became the symbol of people and of the State: it was engraved on coins. Napoleon preferred the eagle, the symbol of imperial Rom, but the raptor was soon shooed away from France. Today, the French rooster can be seen in many places: on French stamps, at the entrance of the Palace.</p>

              <p class="grey left"> Pakistan, Finland, India, and Mexico each have more than four national animals. Pakistan has six distinct animals. The country is ultimately represented by their main national animal: the Markhor. However, Pakistan also lists a national aquatic animal, the Indus river dolphin, a national bird, the Chukar, and a national reptile, the Indus crocodile. They also have a national heritage bird: the Shaheen falcon, which we categorized as a national bird on the map. </p>
